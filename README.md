KODA
==========

Koda is a DAW built for Google Chrome.

#Design Parameters

##Open

1. **No proprietary file formats.** When in doubt everything should be JSON. That JSON, in turn, should be carefully thought out to be as human-
readable as possible. This includes (but is not limited to) project files and instrument patches.

2. **Seamless collaboration and distribution.** The web is already a great place to consume music, but what about creating music? Make it as easy as possible 
for musicians to find other musicians and be inspired. Respect the artistic process; artists need to have good controls over what is shared and what is private.

3. **Let the light in.** Koda should feel clean and well-lit, an inviting place to work. 

4. **Scrutable.** Inscrutability in design is a sin; the feeling of being confused and overwhelmed, not knowing where to start. This can arise either from feature bloat or
(more common today) overly cute minimalism. Always be scrutable.

##Expressive

1. **Low barrier to entry.** A new user should be able to grasp the fundamentals of Koda within minutes. Any software that requires classes to even start is a failure.

2. **No limit.** Users should not need to outgrow Koda. The amount that they get out of the software should be proportional to the time that they spend learning its features.


#Business Plan

##Company Purpose

To create software to bring together music creation, collaboration and distribution.

##Problem

Quality music software is expensive and difficult to use in collaboration with other musicians.

Now, customers have found a variety of ways to get around this by using Dropbox or other cloud sharing sites. 
The problem with this is that it can get messy to do version control and there is not seamless way to do it (software and backup are not linked). There is also no easy step from this 
ad hoc sharing and social distribution.

##Solution

Music software that is cloud native can fulfill these other roles (collaboration and distribution) seamlessly. It will also provide ancillary benefits, such as portability.

##Why Now

The rise of the prosumer music production market has changed every aspect of music, from its production to its consumption. The next phase of this development is go fully cloud native, 
in step with the rest of software.

- Recent trends
    - Web Audio API, Web MIDI API, Hardware accelerated javascript.
    - Proliferation of computing platforms (phones, tablets, phablets, netbook, etc.)
    - Other creative software (CAD, Adobe CS) is moving to the cloud, part of a broader trend towards SaaS (software as a service).

##Market Size

These are estimates and don't have numbers just yet.

- **TAM** All people interested in producing music on a computer.
- **SAM** Early adopters, non-professionals, those not tied to legacy systems.
- **SOM** A couple thousand users a month.
