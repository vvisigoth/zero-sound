KODA
==========

Koda is a DAW built for Google Chrome.

#Design Parameters

##Open

1. **No proprietary file formats.** When in doubt everything should be JSON. That JSON, in turn, should be carefully thought out to be as human-
readable as possible. This includes (but is not limited to) project files and instrument patches.

2. **Seamless sharing and collaboration.** The web is already a great place to consume music, but what about creating music? Make it as easy as possible 
for musicians to find other musicians and be inspired. Respect the artistic process; artists need to have good controls over what is shared and what is private.

3. **Let the light in.** Koda should feel clean and well-lit, an inviting place to work. 

4. **Scrutable.** Inscrutability in design is a sin; the feeling of being confused and overwhelmed, not knowing where to start. This can arise either from feature bloat or
(more common today) overly cute minimalism. Always be scrutable.

##Expressive

1. **Low barrier to entry.** A new user should be able to grasp the fundamentals of Koda within minutes. Any software that requires classes to even start is a failure.

2. **No limit.** Users should not need to outgrow Koda. The amount that they get out of the software should be proportional to the time that they spend learning its features.
